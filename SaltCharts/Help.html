    <strong>Navigating the Map</strong>
    <p>You can move around the map view in several ways.  
    You can drag the map to the desired position directly, or drag the horizontal and vertical coordinate bars to move only one direction.  
    You can also use the navigation buttons at the top left to move the map by half the screen width and center the map.</p>
    <strong>Creating a Waypoint</strong>
    <p>Create a waypoint by choosing any combination* of the island and marker buttons.  Right click a cell on the map to place the waypoint. 
    You can alter the waypoint appearance without removing names and notes by repeating the process over an existing waypoint.</p>
    <p><em style="font-size: small">*Deep Sea cannot have a marker.  If a marker is selected with the Deep Sea type, it will be ignored.</em></p>
    <strong>Adding a Name and Notes</strong>
    <p>To name a waypoint or add notes, click an existing waypoint.  In the resulting dialog you can type the name and notes.  
    Names and notes will appear in the status bar at the bottom of the window when the mouse is moved over the waypoint.</p>
    <strong>Deleting a Waypoint</strong>
    <p>Delete a waypoint in the same way you would create one by selecting the No Island and No Marker buttons together.
    If the waypoint has a name or notes you will be asked to confirm the deletion.</p>
    <strong>Saving the Map</strong>
    <p>By default the map is automatically saved when a waypoint is created, deleted, altered, named, or has notes added.
    You can alter this behavior by clicking the settings button.  When AutoSave is turned off a save button will appear in the toolbar.</p>
    <strong>Creating a New Map</strong>
    <p>Create a new map by clicking the New button in the toolbar.  You will be asked to provide a name for the map, it is strongly suggested you use the seed name.
    Maps will always be created in the folder the application is located and will use the extension *.map</p>
    <strong>Loading a Map</strong>
    <p>Load an existing map by clicking the Open button in the toolbar.</p>
    <strong>Saving a Map as an Image</strong>
    <p>Save an image of the map by clicking the Save as Image button in the toolbar.  You may save as several image formats including PNG, GIF, JPEG, BMP, and TIF.</p>
